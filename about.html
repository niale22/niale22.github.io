    <p id="about-intro">Hello! My name is Alex Ni, and I am a junior at Marywood University studying Computer Science. I am passionate about web development and enjoy building projects.</p>

    <p id="about-hobby">In my free time, I love playing video games on both PC and console. Gaming allows me to explore different worlds, challenge my skills, and connect with friends online. I also enjoy playing tennis, a sport Iâ€™ve been passionate about since my freshman year of high school. It keeps me active and helps me stay competitive.</p>
